# About me
I am a beginner programmer. I do not plan on having a career in IT, I am more interested in electrical engineering. I decided to learn programming to help with embedded systems and microcontrollers. I love open-source hardware and software because when I was just getting started, I copied a lot of code and designs. Most of the things I make are things I publish for anyone to use or edit (with credit added please!). I hate paywalls, even though they make complete sense (you gotta make money somehow, right?). 

Have a nice day, and thanks for reading!

#### Languages I know,  at least a bit:
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML (I am terrible at it, but I know a bit)
- Java (I was right, it sucks. I hate it.)

#### Languages I want to learn:
- C, C#, C++ (probably not all, but some of them)
- CSS (I want to learn more about CSS, but I know some already)
- Bash
- SQL

### Contact:
Putting this here just in case someone wants to contact me for some reason. If you are looking at an archive of this page there is a possibility that it changed or I stuck a knife in a toaster (which is unlikely).
